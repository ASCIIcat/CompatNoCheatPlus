STACK
---------
?(add) more intricate load order stuff ?
!(add) Limit blockbreaking speed by mcmmo (config) !


***
!(add) reload command

? another sequence number (for standard events)

*** ADD MORE GENERIC HOOKS

!add check type and permission hooks, also for worldguard regions.

***

Citizens2 / Player class: make configurable (hidden) Or do internally: List of checks to use , exclude moving if possible.


Generic abstract class for the mcMMO style cancelling of next x events + ticks alive etc

add stats hook ?

add a good mechanism for adding external configurable hooks (read automatically from the cncp config).

*** 6.1.X
!(add) Use some exemption mechanism for npcs (generic player class hook + citizens).
!consider remove: clearing the VL ? => probably not, needs redesign to also monitor block break. + only clear the necessary bits (not frequency)

! try: insta break: keep exemption (unless cancelled) for next block break event (!). -> maybe ncp


? HookInstaBreak : add static method to sset check types to exempt from for next break ?

cncp: check at least for logs / leaves for skill specific block types


hookiinstabreak: let hooks fail completely if listeners are failing to register ?


*** CLEANUP THIS, BETTER METHODS, INTEGRATE SOME INTO NCP MAYBE

* Auto detection of unknown events + log on disable + info command.
? analysis tools like event-Mirror ?

* More generic hooks, clean methods!

! Strip down mcMMO hook to add a new one / integrate into instabreak
! Clean up hooks, use TickTask and "next" to confine fuzzy unexemption to a minimum.

--------------------------

? register listeners with NCP directly? also use annotations ?

! if SpoutPlugin is present: add blocks to ignorepassable automatically / adjust flags ? [generic block setup]
