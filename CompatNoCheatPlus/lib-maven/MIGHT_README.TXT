This "lib-maven" folder contains dependencies for maven, 
which is BAD practice.

It is not even wanted, but i will not change it before i have time to
set up a maven repository for convenient integration. 
 
Would not mind people helping out on the basic knowledge for set-up,
i will likely postpone this until cncp is dead due to getting integrated
into NCP partly, or until i have had time and reason to learn how to
set up a convenient (local?) maven repository working with Jenkins 
and manual jar-adding.
